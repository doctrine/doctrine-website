Release Policy
==============

We do not enforce a release schedule, or even synchronize releases
between the various Doctrine projects.

However, we strive to maintain every project in a state that is ready
for release at any time. This means that if you need something released,
you can let us know, and we will make time to do so.

The primary way to contact us is via
`Slack <https://www.doctrine-project.org/slack>`_.
