Sponsorship
===========

Doctrine has a few different ways we generate funding to support the project. The funds collected are
used to pay for the projects infrastructure costs as well as to support the Doctrine maintainers with
funds for swag and travel costs when visiting conferences to support the project.

This page aims to document all the ways in which you can contribute to the project financially. Of course,
if you can't contribute financially, consider `contributing with code </contribute/index.html>`_.
