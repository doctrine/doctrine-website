We released the first maintenance versions of Common, DBAL and ORM
today. See the changelogs for more information:


-  `ORM, 26 Bugs fixed <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DDC/fixforversion/10114>`_
-  `DBAL, 1 Bug fixed <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10115>`_
-  Common, no known bugs

We also optimized the build process, so that the Version Classes in
the Git Tags do not contain the "-DEV" suffix anymore.

You can get the code from `Git <http://github.com/doctrine>`_ ,
`our PEAR channel <http://pear.doctrine-project.org>`_ or from the
`download section <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects>`_ of
the website.
