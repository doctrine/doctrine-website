Over the past several months, Doctrine has done some growing up.
While the code has been under constant development for over 2
years, it hasn't been until the last 6 months that Doctrine has
gotten a proper home and infrastructure to support the growth of
the project over the coming years. Some of the things we've been
able to accomplish are listed below:

Standardized svn and trac urls to svn/trac.phpdoctrine.org

Brand new design and official logo by Phu Son

   </li><li>
   
Setup donation collections for the Doctrine project

Migrated doctrine.pengus.net to phpdoctrine.org permanently

   </li><li>
   
Initiated proper package/release branch management to ensure
stability for our users

And of course continuing development towards 1.0

All these things are great for the project and we hope it serves
the project well in the long run. Now we have some plans from today
on. Soon we will begin to phase out the 0.9 branch completely and
it will be replaced with the 0.10 branch. In the coming days we
will release 0.9.1 and 0.10.1. The next release after that will be
0.10.2 and the 0.9 branch will officially not be supported any
longer. Everyone will be recommended to upgrade to 0.10.2. On
another note, trunk development towards 1.0 has been furious in the
past month or so. Romanb has spearheaded the re factorings required
to bring Doctrine to the level required for a 1.0 release. We will
continue developing in trunk towards 1.0 while maintaining the
0.10.x branch bringing you bug fixes daily.
