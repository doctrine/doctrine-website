Some of these announcements are a little late but I think they deserve a
proper announcement.

First, we have setup a way for you to give us all your money :) Please
feel free to give a little. The purpose of the Doctrine donation
collection is simple. The creators of Doctrine don't work on this great
product for any money. The contributions are made out of the pure
enjoyment of working on a great open source project such as Doctrine. It
is not totally clear what *exactly* the donations will be used for now,
but in the future they may be used to fund infrastructure expenses
required by the project, sending developers to conferences, marketing,
or even split amongst the developers of Doctrine. So if you or your
company uses Doctrine and are happy with it, a donation to further the
project would be much appreciated.

Secondly, we have made some updates to the website. Specifically the
Download page. It now has proper links to packages and svn for each
release of Doctrine. These packages are generated nightly from the
source in svn.

Finally, as some of you all may already know, we have finally gotten our
release/package management under control and you can expect stability in
the area of releases, branches and BC breaks!
