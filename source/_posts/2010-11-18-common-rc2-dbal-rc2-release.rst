Today we are happy to announce the second release candidate of
Doctrine Common and the first, second and third release candidate
(yes, all in one!) of DBAL.

In the Common package 3 bugs have been fixed, in the DBAL package 9
bugs have been fixed. See the changelogs for details:


-  `Common RC1 Changelog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DCOM/fixforversion/10093>`_
-  `DBAL RC3 Changelogt <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10094>`_

We are especially thankful for the support Microsoft has been
giving us to integrate PDO Sqlsrv. Juozas was invited to
`Jumpin Camp <http://www.jumpincamp.com>`_ and had time to finish
full support for the SQL Server.

The release of the first release candidate of the ORM package is
not far away. We will be waiting some days to get some early
feedback on the latest updates (updated Common and DBAL
dependencies). Expect the first release candidate for someday next
week.
