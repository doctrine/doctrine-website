Check out the latest addition to the Doctrine Cookbook. We have added a
short little tutorial on how to use Doctrine templates to solve a real
world problem to allow Address attributes on many records easily. We
will be publishing many more tutorials in the coming weeks. If you're
interested in contributing a tutorial please contact me at jonwage [at]
