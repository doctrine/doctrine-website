If you're a PHP developer and would like to get familiar with the
concepts behind MVC Frameworks and ORMs then you should attend one of
the Sensio Labs hosted training sessions taught by one of our expert
consultants.

The course covers many topics such as:

-   Refactoring a flat file PHP application in to a MVC framework
-   Templating
-   Working environment
-   Routing and HTTP protocol
-   Object Relational Mapper
-   Using the session
-   Unit and Functional Testing
-   Caching your data

The training utilizes the Symfony MVC framework and the Doctrine Object
Relational Mapper as the tools of choice for the workshop.

If you are interested in attending one of these sessions please contact
me at [jonathan.wage@sensio.com](mailto:jonathan.wage@sensio.com) so we
can discuss details.
