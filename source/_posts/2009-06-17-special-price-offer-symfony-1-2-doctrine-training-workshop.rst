As you all may know, I work for
`Sensio Labs <http://www.sensiolabs.com>`_ , the creators of the
`Symfony <http://www.symfony-project.org>`_ framework. Sensio
offers trainings in many topics, but primarily Symfony and
Doctrine. I will be teaching a training session June 29th to July
1st in the San Francisco bay area that covers Symfony 1.2 and
Doctrine 1.0. We are having a little issue completely filling the
class and I need a few more trainees in order to fill the class to
maintain the date, otherwise we'll have to cancel.

I am able to make a special offer to any interested parties on the
price of the training. All things are negotiable. So if you would
like to attend the 3 day workshop taught by myself and learn the
best practices when using Symfony and Doctrine, contact me right
away! Remember, the price is completely negotiable so if you're a
student or a member of a development team and would like to attend
please contact me so we can negotiate a price that works for you.

You can contact me at jonathan.wage@sensio.com to discuss details.
