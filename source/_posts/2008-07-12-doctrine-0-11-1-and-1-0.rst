   <p>
   
Today we have released a new version, 0.11.1. As with all point
releases it is a bug fix only release. With over 81 tickets closed,
this is definetly a significant release for Doctrine towards 1.0.
We recommend that you upgrade.

We have also created the 1.0 branch and will begin actively working
on it. We have hit the final straight away towards 1.0! This was
originally slated to be the 0.12 branch but we feel it is ready and
we will spend the next 2 months furiously working on tickets before
we release it on September 1st. We will have some short
intermediate BETA and RC releases before then but these will
primarily be bug fix releases only. Make some hype please, thanks.
;)
