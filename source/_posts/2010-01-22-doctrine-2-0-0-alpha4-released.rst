What is Next?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are planning to work towards entering beta from here on. There
are still some backwards-incompatible changes to come. Once we hit
beta, efforts will concentrate on fixing bugs and further
stabilizing the code base. The first beta release is currently
scheduled for March 1st, 2010.
