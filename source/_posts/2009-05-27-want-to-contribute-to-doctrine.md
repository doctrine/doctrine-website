Looking for Developers
======================

We've been on the hunt for more Doctrine contributors. As the number of
users of Doctrine grew we expected the number of commiters to rise with
it but this has not been the case. We do get a lot of small patches here
and there, but we are hoping for some of them to grow in to full-time
core developers that are involved with all the decisions made about
Doctrine.

Call to the community
=====================

You can see Roman made a call to the Doctrine developers mailing list
[here](http://groups.google.com/group/doctrine-dev/browse_thread/thread/c6e4c74e1a392909)
about the issue. We are taking all the feedback in to consideration and
we have started by creating a
[contribute](http://www.doctrine-project.org/contribute) page that is
linked from the primary menu of the website. We hope that this will help
with new users finding information faster about how they can get started
contributing.

Other Ideas
===========

If you have any additional ideas about how we can promote contributing
to Doctrine you can discuss them in the comments or on the [mailing list
thread](http://groups.google.com/group/doctrine-dev/browse_thread/thread/c6e4c74e1a392909).
