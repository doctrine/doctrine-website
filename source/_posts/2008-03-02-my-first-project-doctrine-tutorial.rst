I have put together a short and sweet tutorial on how to get
started using Doctrine in under 5 minutes. A few weeks ago, we
announced the sandbox package which allows you to get started using
Doctrine with a zero configuration sandbox environment. The
tutorial is built using this sandbox package and shows you how
Doctrine can be easily implemented and used in your web
applications.
