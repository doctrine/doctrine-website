Today, "rubenv" pinged me in IRC and told me he has put together an
article on how to get started using Doctrine with the Zend Framework.
The article is very simple and does not get in to the detailed usage of
Doctrine, but it shows you how you to integrate the two frameworks
together and even shows a very simple web application. The article can
be found here.
