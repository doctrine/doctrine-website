Last night the 1000th ticket came rolling in. This is just a
reminder to the fact that Doctrine while still young, has had a
very long and evolutionary life so far. The growth this first
quarter in the community and contributions from all over the world
really shows that Doctrine has a bright future in PHP and I look
forward to seeing all the doors that Doctrine will open. Thanks
everyone!
