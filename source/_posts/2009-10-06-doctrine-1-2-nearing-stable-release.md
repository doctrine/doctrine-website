Today I am happy to release to you the second ALPHA release of Doctrine
1.2. Honestly, we didn't receive many reports of regressions or problems
with the new things in Doctrine 1.2 and we know lots of people have
upgraded and using it so we feel it is a pretty stable release already.

You can view what all changed in this release by checking the
[changelog](http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_ALPHA2) and
you can snag it from the
[download](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download) page.

We hope that everything goes fine from here and the next release will be
BETA1 followed by an RC and stable release. Please give 1.2 a try and
report any regressions to us so that we can be sure to get them fixed
before the final stable release.
