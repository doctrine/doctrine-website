Here is a short update on the current project status. We're heavily
developing towards a 1.0 release that will bring lots of
enhancements like improved inheritance mapping and lots of other
stuff. We're especially keen on making this release as stable as
possible and on polishing the documentation.

Until then we strongly encourage everyone to use the 0.9 branch
that can be found here: http://svn.phpdoctrine.org/branches/0.9
It's a feature-frozen branch that recieves bugfixes. There will be
no changes that break backwards compatibility in this branch.

The current trunk is under heavy development, so please don't use
it unless you are developing on Doctrine's source code or you are
just very curious.

When the time for the 1.0 release comes near we will provide a
migration guide and do everything possible to help you take the
leap from 0.9 to 1.0.

PS: At this point, the the whole Doctrine team wants to apologize
for the version mess you've gone through (and are still getting
through). We really messed up in terms of release management mainly
due to the lack of experience in this area. This stops here. 0.9
will stay and it will stay for a while. We're not going to rush
releases again.

Thank you very much.
