As you probably already noticed, the Doctrine website looks a
little bit different. In preparation for the Doctrine 2.0 release,
the website needed to be improved a little bit to better handle the
multiple versions and projects under the Doctrine umbrella. Along
the way I did a little spring cleaning of some code from the early
Doctrine days as well!

You can now find dedicated sections of the website for both the
Object Relational Mapper and Database Abstraction Layer projects:


-  `ORM Project <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm>`_
-  `DBAL Project <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal>`_

The new website also introduces a new API Documentation thanks to
`PHP Doctor <http://peej.github.com/phpdoctor/>`_!


-  `Doctrine 2 ORM API Documentation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/2.0/api>`_
-  `Doctrine 2 DBAL API Documentation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal/2.0/api>`_

If you have any problems with the website please let me know by
e-mail at jonwage [at] gmail.com.
