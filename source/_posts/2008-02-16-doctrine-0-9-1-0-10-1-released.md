Today the Doctrine team is proud to announce the release of Doctrine
0.9.1 and 0.10.1. Both releases bring many fixes and a few minor
additions for missing features in each of the branches. The next release
of 0.10.2 will replace the 0.9 branch and all users will be recommended
to upgrade as the 0.9 branch will no longer be supported and maintained
by the core dev team. We except that 0.10.2 is due in two to three
weeks. Please upgrade your existing projects from 0.9 to 0.10 and let us
know what issues you come across when switching so we can ensure a
smooth migration from 0.9 to 0.10 for all of our users.

On a side note, many new changes have been made to the website. A few
visual things and a few functional things. You will now find on the
Download page you can now get Doctrine in either zip or tgz format. We
also have our very own PEAR server so you are able to install Doctrine
via the pear command line interface. Our channel is located at
pear.phpdoctrine.org and can be discovered by running 'pear
channel-discover pear.phpdoctrine.org'
