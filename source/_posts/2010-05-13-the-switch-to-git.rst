Now that the dust has settled from the move to git I suppose it is
time for a blog post. About a month ago, we made the decision to
switch the Doctrine projects source control to
`git <http://git-scm.com>`_. Like many other
`open source projects <http://www.symfony-project.org>`_ , we also
chose `github.com <http://www.github.com>`_ to host our
repositories. Github brings a whole new level of collaborative
coding to the Doctrine community and I can already see more people
getting involved because of it.

Still want to use SVN?
----------------------

If you still want to use subversion externals in your project, you
can do so by using the read-only SVN features of github.com:


-  Doctrine 1.2 - http://svn.github.com/doctrine/doctrine1.git
-  Doctrine 2.0 - http://svn.github.com/doctrine/doctrine2.git

You can read about this feature on the github
`blog <http://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support>`_.

Need to learn git?
------------------

Through the process of moving to git, we have all had to learn lots
but it could not have been done without the
`Pro Git Book <http://progit.org/>`_. It is an awesome book written
by `Scott Chacon <http://twitter.com/CHACON>`_ who works at github
and is a git guru among other things.. The book can be ordered or
can be `read online <http://progit.org/book/>`_ for free!

Want to contribute to Doctrine?
-------------------------------

If you are interested in contributing to the Doctrine project, you
will need to fork one of the Doctrine
`repositories <http://github.com/doctrine>`_ and submit your
modifications. You can read more about how to
`"Fork a project and submit your modifications" <http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications/7>`_
on the github website.
