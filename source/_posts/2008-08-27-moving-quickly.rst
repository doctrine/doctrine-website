   <p>
   
Right out of the gate we're moving extremely fast. Only two days in
to working full-time on the project we've made some significant
pushes forward. On Monday we made available the first 1.0 Release
Candidate and then immediately began working on the second and
final release candidate. This milestone is extremely significant as
it already contains over 70 closed tickets! It will be released
either Wednesday or Thursday and 1.0 Stable will follow after it on
Monday September 1st. Below are some other highlights on the
progress made so far.
