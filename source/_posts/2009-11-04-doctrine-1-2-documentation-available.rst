I am happy to announce that
`Doctrine 1.2 documentation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_2/en>`_
is now available and up to date. It might still need some work but
for the most part it is updated with all the new features and
changes in 1.2.

New Chapters
~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  `Data Hydrators <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_2/en/data-hydrators>`_
-  `Extensions <http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_2/en/extensions>`_

Please read over it and create
`Jira <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira>`_ issues for any
problems or corrections you find.
