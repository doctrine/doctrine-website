Well, we discovered some bugs in the last RC of 0.11 so we have decided
to have another release candidate to make sure the 0.11 branch is a
solid major release of Doctrine. As always the changelog can be read in
the CHANGELOG in svn or on the website. Hopefully this will really be
the last release candidate of 0.11 and we will release a stable version.
Once 0.11 is released we plan to immediately begin working on 0.11.1 bug
fix release as well as a new 0.12 branch which will bring some new
features as well as dozens of bug fixes. Thanks for all the
contributions from the core developers and community for this release.
