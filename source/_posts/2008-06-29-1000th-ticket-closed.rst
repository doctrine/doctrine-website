Tonight I have closed the 1000th ticket in the Doctrine Trac. This
is a big milestone for Doctrine and it has taken the work of many
people to reach this. Thanks to all the users who took the time to
report issues to us (test case or not ;) ), it is much appreciated
and Doctrine would not be able to move forward without it.
