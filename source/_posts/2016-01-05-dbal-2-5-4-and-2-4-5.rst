We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL
`2.5.4 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/v2.5.4>`_ and
`2.4.5 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/releases/tag/v2.4.5>`_.

DBAL 2.5.4
~~~~~~~~~~

SQLite types weren't correctly identified when whitespace was present in the
table definitions: the DBAL now correctly recognizes that, and ignores the
whitespace. `#2272 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/2272>`_

constant ``PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_PREPARES`` is only defined when PGSQL support
for PHP is enabled with PDO. The DBAL now checks whether the constant is available
before relying on it. `#2249 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/2249>`_

DBAL 2.4.5
~~~~~~~~~~

This release backports a number of fixes that were already present in DBAL 2.5.3.

Specifically, following issues were solved:

- SQLite offset with no limit support `#1069 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1069>`_
- Fix removing autoincrement column from a primary key `#1074 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1074>`_
- Infinite recursion on non-unique table/join alias in QueryBuilder `#1079 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1079>`_
- Fix for bad profiling data, showing an indefinitely long query `#1124 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1124>`_
- Fix incorrect ordering of columns in clustered indexes on sql server `#1129 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1129>`_
- Avoid fatal error in ``array_merge`` while generating the table creation SQL `#1141 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1141>`_
- ``template1`` as default database for PostgreSQL `#1162 <https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/1162>`_

Please be advised that this is the last 2.4.x release, and except for security releases,
no further patches will be provided for DBAL 2.4: please upgrade to 2.5 as soon as possible.
