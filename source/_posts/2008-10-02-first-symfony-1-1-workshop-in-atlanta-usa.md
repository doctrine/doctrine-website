To celebrate, we organize our first symfony training in Atlanta between
October 29th and 31th. The training will be based on the latest symfony

Promenade II").

This symfony workshop will be given by a symfony expert coming from
France and Jonathan Wage, the Doctrine lead developer, and a seasoned
symfony developer.??A symfony workshop is an interactive training
