Today I am very excited to announce to you all that we have
officially invited Benjamin Eberlei, also known as beberlei in IRC,
to join the core Doctrine team. He has steadily contributed to
Doctrine 2 and has been very helpful. We are confident that he will
be a great new addition to the team.

Benjamin is a contributor to the Zend Framework as well so he will
be responsible for leading the integration between the projects.
You can read a little more about Benjamin on his
`about page <http://www.doctrine-project.org/contributor/beberlei>`_.
