I have been using php.net style API lookups ever since I can
remember. It is very nice being able to simply go to
http://php.net/array\_walk and have it pull up that function in the
PHP API Documentation. So, tonight i have implemented this
functionality in to the Doctrine website. Below are some examples
of how you can quickly access the API docs for a specific function
or class.

function

   </li><li>
   
http://www.phpdoctrine.org/getParams - Single function that exists
in multiple classes

   </li></ul>
