This morning Fabien from the symfony project announced the roadmap
for the next major version of symfony, 1.2. He announced that
Doctrine would be officially supported as a "first class citizen."
The time couldn't be better as symfony 1.2 is scheduled to be
released in October and Doctrine is slated to release 1.0 around
the same time. This is good news for Doctrine, symfony and more
importantly PHP in general. I look forward to seeing what comes of
all this in the coming months.
