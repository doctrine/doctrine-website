Check out the latest addition to the Doctrine Cookbook. We have
added a short little tutorial on how to use Doctrine templates to
solve a real world problem to allow Address attributes on many
records easily. We will be publishing many more tutorials in the
coming weeks. If you're interested in contributing a tutorial
please contact me at jonwage [at] gmail.com.
