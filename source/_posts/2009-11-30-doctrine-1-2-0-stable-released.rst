Today I am very happy to announce that Doctrine 1.2.0 stable has
been released. This is a very significant release for Doctrine as
it contains a lot of valuable enhancements and bug fixes. This will
most likely be the last new version of the Doctrine 1 branch that
we release. This means that it is the last LTS(long term support)
release as it is supported for a full 18 months. Below is the
current proposed support schedule for the available Doctrine 1
versions.

\| Version \| Supported Until \| \| ---------------------- \|
--------------------- \| \| Doctrine 1.0 \| 03/01/2010 \| \|
Doctrine 1.1 \| 03/01/2010 \| \| Doctrine 1.2 \| 06/01/2011 \|

Originally 1.1 was scheduled to end support on 11/01/2009, but we
have decided to support it until 03/01/2010 to give people enough
time to upgrade to 1.2. After 03/01/2010 Doctrine 1.2 will be the
only actively supported version of Doctrine 1.
