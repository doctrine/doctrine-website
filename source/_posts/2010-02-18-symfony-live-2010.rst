This past week I had the pleasure of spending time in Paris, France
for the `2010 Symfony Live <http://www.symfony-live.com>`_
conference. My first Symfony event was
`Symfony Camp <http://www.symfonycamp.com>`_ in 2008 which was a
great success. I also attended the first Symfony Live last year
where I spoke about `Sympal <http://www.sympalphp.org>`_ and
Doctrine. This time around the Symfony conference was an even
bigger success! The community around Symfony and Doctrine has grown
a great amount over the years and the event shows that! Many great
speakers and topics were present at the conference and it was very
exciting to get to be a part of it.

On the first day of the conference I was invited to speak about the
latest Doctrine 2! This is perfect timing as Fabien Potencier made
available the source code of
`Symfony 2 <http://www.symfony-reloaded.org>`_ the following day. I
am very excited about what the future holds for PHP in the coming
years as Symfony 2 and Doctrine 2 are really revolutionary PHP
projects!

You can find the presentations given at the conference related to
Doctrine below:


-  `Using Doctrine Migrations <http://www.slideshare.net/denderello/symfony-live-2010-using-doctrine-migrations>`_
-  `Doctrine 2: Not the same Old PHP ORM <http://www.slideshare.net/jwage/doctrine-2-not-the-same-old-php-orm>`_
