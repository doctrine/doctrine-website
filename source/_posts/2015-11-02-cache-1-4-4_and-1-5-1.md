We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine Cache
[1.4.4](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.4.4) and
[1.5.1](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.5.1).

Cache 1.4.4
===========

This release fixes the version number reported in
[Doctrine/Common/Cache/Version::VERSION](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/blob/v1.5.1/lib/Doctrine/Common/Cache/Version.php)

Additionally, a flaw in `CacheProvider#fetchMultiple()` was fixed:
`null` and false-y values being fetched were considered cache misses,
but are now correctly included in the results
([\#104](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/104)).

You can find the complete changelog for this release in the [v1.4.4
release notes](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.4.4).

Cache 1.5.1
===========

This release includes all the fixes mentioned in the above `1.4.4`
patch.

You can find the complete changelog for this release in the [v1.5.1
release notes](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.5.1).
