Today I have deployed some updates to the Doctrine website. Some of
the updates all of you will enjoy, but another specific one might
upset some of you.

I have decided to remove the Doctrine Forum forever and consolidate
the user discussions in to the
`doctrine-user <http://groups.google.com/group/doctrine-user>`_
mailing list which is hosted on Google Groups. I chose to do this
for a few reasons.


-  Consolidate discussions in to one area so the community is not
   split.
-  phpBB is horrible and is proving to be a lot of work for me to
   maintain
-  I don't want to have to spend countless hours maintaining
   something that google groups can do for me, for free

I know this will upset some of you, but I hope you understand and
are happy that the Doctrine developers will now be able to spend
more time...**developing Doctrine**..instead of maintaining the
forum.

Some other changes I have made/fixed.


-  Change Logs are now fixed from the move
-  The `blog <http://www.doctrine-project.org/blog>`_ has been
   enhanced and tags fixed
-  `API Documentation <http://www.doctrine-project.org/Doctrine_Record/1_1>`_
   Enhanced to include browse code links so you can see the code for
   each class, function, etc.
-  A bunch of other small little things tweaked and fixed.

If you find anything wrong with the website or something you'd like
to see different please let me know via the comments below or by
