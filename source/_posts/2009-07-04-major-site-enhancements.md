You've probably noticed over the past few days I have rolled out some
major new site enhancements. You can find more information below about
all the changes made.

Register Now!
=============

I have opened up a new registration portal on the Doctrine website. This
will create a login both on the website and Trac and is also connected
to your SVN account if you choose to request access.

Login Now!
==========

Once you have registered you can login to the
[website](http://www.doctrine-project.org/login) and
[Trac](http://trac.doctrine-project.org/login). This will make some
extra functionality available for you to manage your user information.

New Extensions Repository
=========================

A place where you can browse, search and find out what extensions are
available for Doctrine. It contains documentation, ability to run the
unit tests and download the code.

Check it out [here](http://www.doctrine-project.org/extensions).

User Documentation Area
=======================

For a long time I have wanted to have an area of the website where users
could manage as much user contributed documentation as they want. I have
started the new site with a tutorial on [how to write an
extension](http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/user/1_2/en/how-to-write-an-extension).

New Homepage Look
=================

I have slightly tweaked the homepage design to match the design of the
new Doctrine
[book](http://www.amazon.com/Doctrine-ORM-PHP-Jonathan-Wage/dp/2918390038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246303098&sr=8-1).
This is our first book so if you want to support the Doctrine project or
just want to learn about Doctrine then we suggest you purchase a copy!
:)

Manage your User Account
========================

Central location where you can manage all the information you control as
a Doctrine authenticated user. You can see what extensions you've
written, control your user contributed documentation, request SVN access
and update your account information. Check it out
[here](http://www.doctrine-project.org/user/account).

These changes are primarily based around the new extensions repository
which is available for Doctrine 1.2. You can read about what else is new
in Doctrine 1.2 [here](http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2).
