Last October 2007 we implemented some google analytics to our
website to monitor the growth of the community. Today the traffic
has about doubled since then. We average around 1000 unique
visitors per day up from around 300 roughly 1 year ago. We expect
the growth to continue and we look forward what milestones we can
reach together in the future. Check out the graph of absolute
unique visitors from google analytics below.
