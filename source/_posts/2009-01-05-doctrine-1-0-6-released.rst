Welcome Back
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Don't worry! Doctrine is alive :) It has been a bit quiet around
here due to the holidays. I was able to take a week long vacation
and it was very nice being away from everything for the first time
in almost three years. I hope everyone enjoyed the holidays as much
as I did.

1.0.6 Released
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Anyways, on my first day back I am happy to introduce the freshly
packaged Doctrine 1.0.6 bug fix release. This release contains
dozens of fixes and the change log can be read
`here <http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_0_6>`_. It is
strongly encouraged that you upgrade as soon as possible.

Doctrine 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^

On a side note, we will be releasing the 2nd beta of 1.1 later this
week and we have a few other surprises that will be a part of the
1.1 stable release. So, you will have to stick around to see what
we have planned. You can check out what is new in 1.1 by reading
the `upgrade <http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_1>`_ file.
