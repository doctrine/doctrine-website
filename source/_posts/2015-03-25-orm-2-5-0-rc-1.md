We encourage all of our users to help us by trying out this release.
Please report any possible problems or incompatibilities that may have
been introduced during development.

What is new in 2.5.x?

We are currently in the process of documenting all the changes and new
features that were introduced in Doctrine ORM 2.5.x.

You can find the current state of the 2.5.0 changes overview in [the
upgrade
notes](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/latest/changelog/migration_2_5.html).

Release RoadMap

We expect to release following versions of the ORM in the next days:

> -   `2.5.0` on `2015-04-02`

Please note that these dates may change depending on the availability of
our team.

We also apologise for the major delays in this beta release, which are
caused by the scarce availability of the core team in these months.
