Today I would like to announce the official introduction of the
Doctrine sandbox package. The Doctrine sandbox was first introduced
in SVN a few months ago, but is now available as a downloaded
package. Every major release of Doctrine has a sandbox available
for it. The sandbox is a sample implementation of Doctrine that is
ready to be used with zero configuration. It comes configured with
a sqlite database so it requires that you have pdo sqlite enabled
on your server. The packages can be downloaded here. I have also
put together a small wiki page on how you can get started using the
sandbox to easily play with Doctrine. The wiki page can be found
here.
