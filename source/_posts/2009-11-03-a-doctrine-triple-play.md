Today I am happy to bring you three new versions of Doctrine:

Doctrine 1.0.13
===============

This is a regular maintenance release for the Doctrine 1.0 branch and
contains several bug fixes. Check out the [change
log](http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_0_13) for the changes
contained in this release.

Doctrine 1.1.5
==============

This is a regular maintenance release for the Doctrine 1.1 branch. This
will be the one of the last maintenance release for the Doctrine 1.1
branch as the scheduled support for this version has technically ended
on November 1st. We will have a few more maintenance releases for 1.1
since Doctrine 1.2 is not out yet. We'll give a few months of overlap to
give people some time to upgrade to Doctrine 1.2. Check out the [change
log](http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_1_5) for the changes
contained in this release.

Doctrine 1.2.0-BETA1
====================

This is the first BETA of the Doctrine 1.2 branch. This release is a
very exciting one as it will be a LTS(long term support) version and it
contains lots of new features and bug fixes. Check out the [change
log](http://www.doctrine-project.org/change_log/1_2_0_BETA1) for the
changes contained in this release. You can also see documentation for
everything that has changed or is new in Doctrine 1.2 on the [What's
New](http://www.doctrine-project.org/upgrade/1_2) page.

Like always, you can grab the package for these new versions on the
[download](http://www.doctrine-project.org/download) page.
