Today I am happy to bring you the second maintenance release for
the 1.2 version of Doctrine. This release contains around 100 fixed
issues from
`Jira <http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DC/fixforversion/10047>`_.
We will continue regularly creating maintenance releases for the
Doctrine 1.2 version so if you have any problems, please create a
issue on Jira, include a patch with tests and we'll try and include
it in the next version.

As always you can find information about this new version on the
`download <http://www.doctrine-project.org/download>`_ page.
