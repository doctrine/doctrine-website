   <p>
   
Today, I would like to introduce the latest stable version of
Doctrine, 0.11.0. This release is a major release but it contains
bug fixes only. It contains a few BC enhancements that were
required in order to fix some bugs. We recommend everyone upgrade
to 0.11. Below are some highlights of this release.

Another item worth mentioning about the 0.11 release is that the
integration between Doctrine and symfony has evolved quite well
over the first quarter of 2008 as symfony 1.1 is coming out and
0.11 is released. The integration between symfony 1.1 and Doctrine
with sfDoctrinePlugin is now officially supported by the symfony
core team and we will slowly be introducing more documentation over
the coming months.
