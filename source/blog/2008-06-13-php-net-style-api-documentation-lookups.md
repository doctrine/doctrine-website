I have been using php.net style API lookups ever since I can remember.
It is very nice being able to simply go to https://secure.php.net/array\_walk
and have it pull up that function in the PHP API Documentation. So,
tonight i have implemented this functionality in to the Doctrine
website. Below are some examples of how you can quickly access the API
docs for a specific function or class.

</p><ul><li>

[http://www.phpdoctrine.org/Doctrine](http://www.phpdoctrine.org/Doctrine)
- Single class

</li><li>

[http://www.phpdoctrine.org/Doctrine::getTable](http://www.phpdoctrine.org/Doctrine::getTable)
- Single class function

</li><li>

[http://www.phpdoctrine.org/getParams](http://www.phpdoctrine.org/getParams)
- Single function that exists in multiple classes 

</li></ul>
