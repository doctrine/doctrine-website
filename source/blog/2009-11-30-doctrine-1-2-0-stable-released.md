Today I am very happy to announce that Doctrine 1.2.0 stable has been
released. This is a very significant release for Doctrine as it contains
a lot of valuable enhancements and bug fixes. This will most likely be
the last new version of the Doctrine 1 branch that we release. This
means that it is the last LTS(long term support) release as it is
supported for a full 18 months. Below is the current proposed support
schedule for the available Doctrine 1 versions.

| Version | Supported Until | | ---------------------- |
--------------------- | | Doctrine 1.0 | 03/01/2010 | | Doctrine 1.1 |
03/01/2010 | | Doctrine 1.2 | 06/01/2011 |

Originally 1.1 was scheduled to end support on 11/01/2009, but we have
decided to support it until 03/01/2010 to give people enough time to
upgrade to 1.2. After 03/01/2010 Doctrine 1.2 will be the only actively
supported version of Doctrine 1.
