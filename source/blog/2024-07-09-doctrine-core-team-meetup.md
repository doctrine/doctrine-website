We are organizing another Doctrine Core Team Meetup in Bonn, Germany from Tuesday,
8.10.2024 to Thursday, 10.10.2024 at the offices of one of our
sponsors Tideways GmbH.

The goal is to get the current team together, discuss and work on Doctrine DBAL, ORM and ODM.

We thank all of our GitHub and OpenCollective sponsors for making this possible.
