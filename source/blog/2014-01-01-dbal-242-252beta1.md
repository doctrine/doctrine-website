We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine DBAL
2.4.2 and 2.5.0 BETA1.

The new stable version 2.4.2 had 20 bugs fixed. You can install this
version using Composer and the following `composer.json` contents:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .json}
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/dbal": "2.4.2"
    }
}
~~~~

You can see all the changes on Jira:

    2.4.2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira/browse/DBAL/fixforversion/10620)

In the first 10 month of 2013 we watched the number of open issues cross
100 and peak at 250 in mid November, unable to do much about it due to
time constraints. During the last two months however we have worked hard
to lower the number of open pull-requests on DBAL from 50 to only 7 and
push the number of open issues on DBAL+ORM down to 188 from 250. This
has been a tremendous effort and it would not have been possible without
our two new core team members [deeky666](https://github.com/deeky666)
and [kimhemsoe](https://github.com/kimhemsoe).

With the number of open bugs at 22 and open pull requests at 7 I am
excited to say that DBAL 2.5 will be the most stable and complete
version so far. It is mostly backwards compatible with only some minor
changes necessary, when using PDO IBM, creating a custom platform or
using non-default DateTime formats. You can see the breaks in the
[UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/UPGRADE.md)
file.

There is also a nice list of new features:

-   Support for SAP Sybase SQL Anywhere versions 10, 11, 12 and 16
    (DBAL-475)
-   Support for auto-commit=NO on all drivers and platforms. (DBAL-81)
-   Refactor exceptions to use common error-codes and exception classes
    that derive from `Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException`. (DBAL-407)
-   Add support to retry connections with
    `Doctrine\DBAL\Connection#ping()` method. (DBAL-275)
-   Add INSERT support to QueryBuilder (DBAL-320)
-   Add Binary type for VARBINARY support (DBAL-714)
-   Add charset and SSL connection support to PostgreSQL (DBAL-567,
    DBAL-702)
-   Add options support for Myqli (DBAL-643)
