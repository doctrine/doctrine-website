Today, over on the symfony-project blog. A short tutorial on how to get
started using Doctrine and symfony 1.1 has been published. As of symfony
1.1, Doctrine is officially supported by symfony and this is the first
step of many to make Doctrine the default ORM in symfony. Over the
coming months, much of the symfony + Propel documentation will be ported
to work with Doctrine. The tutorial can be read here.
