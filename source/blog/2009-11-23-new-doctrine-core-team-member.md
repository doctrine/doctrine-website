Today I am very excited to announce to you all that we have officially
invited Benjamin Eberlei, also known as beberlei in IRC, to join the
core Doctrine team. He has steadily contributed to Doctrine 2 and has
been very helpful. We are confident that he will be a great new addition
to the team.

Benjamin is a contributor to the Zend Framework as well so he will be
responsible for leading the integration between the projects. You can
read a little more about Benjamin on his [about
page](http://www.doctrine-project.org/contributor/beberlei).
