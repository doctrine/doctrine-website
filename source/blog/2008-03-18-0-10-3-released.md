A few days late, but the 0.10.3 release has been packaged and released.
This release contains nearly 40 closed tickets, and is a huge step
towards bringing the 1st generation of Doctrine to a stable release. We
have already begun development on the 0.10.4 release, and have a few
dozen tickets associated to it already. If you have a ticket associated
to the 0.10.4 milestone or any other release then it is likely their is
not a failing test case for it, as the 0.10 branch now only has 1
failing test case. Make our job easier and provide a failing test case
for your issues. Thanks.
