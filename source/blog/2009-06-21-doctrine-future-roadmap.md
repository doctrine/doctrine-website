So, lately we've been discussing and getting a lot of questions about
the future roadmap of Doctrine, specifically 2.0. If you are following
PHP 5.3 you will have noticed that PHP 5.3 RC4 was released last week.
This means that the stable release of 5.3 is very near.

Below you will find a schedule of the roadmap we have planned for the
upcoming months/years.

| Date | Item | | -------------- |
------------------------------------------------ | | 06/22/2009 | Branch
Doctrine 1.2 | | 06/24/2009 | PHP 5.3.0 Stable Release (YES!!!) | |
09/2009 | Begin 1.2 release cycle. Alpha, Beta, RC, Stable | | 09/2009 |
Final 6 months of 1.0 Support | | 09/2009 | Launch 2.0 Alpha 1 | |
11/2009 | Launch 1.2.0 with Long Term Support (18 months) | | 11/2009 |
Symfony 1.3 + Doctrine 1.2 | | 11/2009 | End Doctrine 1.1 Support | |
03/2010 | End Doctrine 1.0 Support | | 03/2010 | Continue 2.0 release
cycle | | ??/2010 | Release 2.0.0 with Long Term Support (18 months) | |
06/2011 | End Doctrine 1.2 Support |

We hope that the above timeline gives PHP 5.3 plenty of time to be
adopted before we officially stop support for the Doctrine 1.x series.
We think it will be plenty of time but depending how things play out, we
can always add more time to the support life cycle of the 1.x series,
but we hope to not have to. So, this Wednesday when PHP 5.3 is released,
please switch to it if you can and help with the adoption.
