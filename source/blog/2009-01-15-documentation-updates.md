Enhancements
============

Over the past few days I have rolled out some changes to the
documentation which are mostly aesthetic. Overall the changes make the
documentation much richer and easier to read.

Some of the changes made to the documentation are listed below:

-   Added next and previous links to navigate between chapters
-   Adding syntax highlight to YAML examples
-   Added syntax highlighting to SQL/DQL examples
-   Enhanced PHP syntax highlighting colors
-   Added styled caption boxes for notes, tips, sidebars and cautions
-   Other miscellaneous styling enhancements

Why?
====

Why are we making these enhancements? This is in preparation for a new
version of the manual which will be the first piece of documentation on
Doctrine available in print! We will release more information about when
this will be available soon.
