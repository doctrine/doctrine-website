As you all may have noticed, we have put up an actual website. The
manual, api documentation, and trac are now all available from the same
interface/design. However, the design you see now is only temporary and
a new design will be implemented in the near future. We have also added
the ability to comment on manual chapters/sections, blog posts, and api
documentation classes.
