We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine Cache
[1.6.0](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.5.2).

Cache 1.6.0
===========

Support for PHP versions below 5.5.0 was removed: please remember that
if you are still using PHP 5.4.x or lower, the PHP project [does not
provide support for those versions
anymore](http://php.net/supported-versions.php).
[\#109](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/109)

Native [APCu](https://github.com/krakjoe/apcu) support was introduced:
if you run newer versions of APCu, then you can use the new
[ApcuCache](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/blob/v1.6.0/lib/Doctrine/Common/Cache/ApcuCache.php)
adapter. [\#115](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/117)

A
[MultiPutCache](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/blob/v1.6.0/lib/Doctrine/Common/Cache/MultiPutCache.php)
interface was introduced: the
[CacheProvider](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/blob/v1.6.0/lib/Doctrine/Common/Cache/CacheProvider.php)
implements it by default now. This interface can lead to improved
performance when saving multiple keys at once, if your cache adapter
supports such an operation.
[\#117](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/117)

The
[ArrayCache](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/blob/v1.6.0/lib/Doctrine/Common/Cache/ArrayCache.php)
now honors the given cache entries TTL, making it possible to use it
even in long running processes without the risk of dealing with stale
data. [\#130](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/130)

Installation
============

You can install the Cache component using the following `composer.json`
definitions:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .shell}
composer require doctrine/cache:^1.6
~~~~

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing
list or on [Jira](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
