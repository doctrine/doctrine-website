I have put together a short and sweet tutorial on how to get started
using Doctrine in under 5 minutes. A few weeks ago, we announced the
sandbox package which allows you to get started using Doctrine with a
zero configuration sandbox environment. The tutorial is built using this
sandbox package and shows you how Doctrine can be easily implemented and
used in your web applications.
