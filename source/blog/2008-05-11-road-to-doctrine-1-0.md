First I would like to thank everyone who has adopted Doctrine and stuck
with us through the many long and difficult development iterations.
Though we have many more, and potentially even more difficult iterations
to get through for Doctrine 2.0, we now see the end of the tunnel for
Doctrine 1.0. I have laid out the official roadmap for 1.0 and it can be
viewed on trac here. The planned release date of Doctrine 1.0 is
September 1st 2008, which is also my 23rd birthday, and Doctrine 2.0
will follow it exactly one year later on September 1st 2009.
