What is Next?
=============

We are planning to work towards entering beta from here on. There are
still some backwards-incompatible changes to come. Once we hit beta,
efforts will concentrate on fixing bugs and further stabilizing the code
base. The first beta release is currently scheduled for March 1st, 2010.
