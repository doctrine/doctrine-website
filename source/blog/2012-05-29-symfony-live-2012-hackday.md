Next week will be [Symfony Live
2012](http://paris2012.live.symfony.com/) in Paris and the Doctrine
DBAL/ORM Team will be represented by Guilherme, Alexander, Marco and me.
Jeremy is also there and knows the MongoDB ODM inside out.

Guilherme and Jeremy will give two talks:

-   "Using MongoDB responsibly" Jeremy Mikola
-   "ORMs don't kill your database, developers do!" Guilherme Blanco

Additionally all of us will participate in the hackday on saturday.

Doctrine 2.3 is around the corner (propably during July) and we still
have some features that we want to finalize and work on together. Feel
free to join us if you want to contribute. We are always looking for
interested developers that help with tickets, support, documentatation
or anything else.

During the conference you can find us by looking for the [dark blue
Doctrine
t-shirts](http://distilleryimage8.instagram.com/30f1aa1ea9d311e1a92a1231381b6f02_7.jpg).
