We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine Cache
[1.5.2](https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.5.2).

Cache 1.5.2
===========

This release corrects a few bugs:

Fetching `false` values from the cache via
`` fetchMultiple` was causing incorrect misses (`#105 <https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/105>`_).  Cache paths were exceeding the windows ``MAX\_PATH`` length (`#107 <https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/107>`_).  The ``MongoDBCache`` was not failing silently in case of DB-side exceptions (`#108 <https://github.com/doctrine/cache/pull/108>`_).  You can find the complete changelog for this release in the `v1.5.2 release notes <https://github.com/doctrine/cache/releases/tag/v1.5.2>`_.  Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~  You can install the Cache component using the following ``composer.json\`\`
definitions:

~~~~ {.sourceCode .json}
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/cache": "~1.5.2"
    }
}
~~~~

Please report any issues you may have with the update on the mailing
list or on [Jira](http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira).
