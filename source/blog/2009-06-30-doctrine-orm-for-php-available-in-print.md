Last night the [Doctrine ORM for
PHP](http://www.amazon.com/Doctrine-ORM-PHP-Jonathan-Wage/dp/2918390038/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1246303098&sr=8-1)
book became available on the Amazon website. This is our first official
piece of published documentation and we are very excited and proud to
see this.

If you are an existing or new Doctrine user, it is much appreciated if
you purchase a copy. Since Doctrine is an open source project we don't
make any money directly from it. Doctrine is all possible because of the
contributors and the companies that fund it, like [Sensio
Labs](http://www.sensiolabs.com). So it is a very nice gesture, even if
you are already a Doctrine expert, to purchase a copy of the book to
show your appreciation and support for the project.
