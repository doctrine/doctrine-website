Today we have some great news! Thanks to Fabien from the [symfony
project](http://www.symfony-project.org) , we now have a new way to
generate the PDF version of our documentation. The new PDFs are a MAJOR
step up from the previous style of PDF and am very pleased with it!
Check it out by viewing the 1.0 version of [The Guide to Doctrine for
PHP](https://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/manual/1_0/en/pdf) or
[The Doctrine
Cookbook](https://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation/cookbook/1_0/en/pdf).

What is next?
=============

-   API Documentation available as PDF.
-   Downloadable package/zip file containing PDF versions of all
    documentation.
-   User submitted articles, snippets, tutorials, etc. to complement the
    official documentation.
-   ...Printed book.

Printed Book
============

Here is a teaser of the first draft of the front cover for the printed
version of the book. Big thanks goes out to Jason O'Brien from
centre{source} for doing the design work. The printed copy will be
available on lulu very soon we just need to do some more proof reading
and Q&A on everything before it is ready. The printed version of the
book will use a slightly modified version of the PDF that is available
for download on the web.
