I am happy to introduce the latest contribution to the 1.0 cookbook,
Creating a Unit of Work Using Doctrine by Jon Lebensold. Big thanks to
him, he reached out to me wanting to contribute something to the project
so he offered to add this great recipe to the cookbook. It properly
demonstrates the unit of work pattern for saving and deleting Doctrine
objects. If you are interested in contributing to Doctrine, adding
something to the cookbook is a great way to help out by only giving 1
hour of your time. Contact me at jonwage [at] gmail.com if you are
interested in contributing.
