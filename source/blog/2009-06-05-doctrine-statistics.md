On October 18th of 2007 I implemented Google Analytics which allowed me
to track the statistics of the website. On that first day of statistics
gathered we had 93 visitors and yesterday we had a little over 1500!
Needless to say that is pretty exciting!

Here is a graph from google analytics that illustrates the growth.

Here are some more statistics gathered:

Hopefully I can make this same post a year from now about the same thing
and Doctrine will have grown with many new versions.
