We are organizing a Doctrine ORM Core Team Meetup in Bonn, Germany from Monday,
9.10.2023 to Wednesday, 11.10.2023 at the offices of one of our primary
sponsors Tideways GmbH.

The goal is to get the current team together, discuss and work on the missing
pieces for the long-awaited Doctrine ORM 3.0 release that is planned for later
this year.
