This evening Doctrine reached a milestone of four thousand commits in
svn. Doctrine has maintained steady development for almost three years
strong, and we feel this milestone is very significant for the evolution
of Doctrine. Today, we would like to announce that the first generation
of Doctrine, also know as 0.10, will be the first real candidate for the
first(second) stable 1.0 version. After 3 point releases of the 0.10
branch we have fixed over 100 tickets, and made huge steps towards the
first stable release of Doctrine. Several months ago, we decided to make
a feature freeze as 0.9 branch, so that we could continue on going
refactorings to Doctrine while providing a stable branch for our users.
Now, several months later, we have evolved to 0.10 and are beginning to
become more and more stable. We have also decided that the developments
in trunk are so significant that they deserve a title of Doctrine 2.0,
the second generation of Doctrine.

Now, we need some help from our users. The 0.10 branch is down to one
failing test case(soon to be fixed). With over 100 unfixed tickets, and
1 failing test case, this means we need some failing test case writing
done :) As I've said before, the best way to ensure your issue is fixed,
is to create a failing test case replicating the issue. You can read
about how to write test cases for the 0.10 branch here.
