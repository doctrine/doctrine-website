For those of you who are not keen on using the mailing list or irc for
getting help with Doctrine, we now have a public Forum, powered by
PHPBB3(which is very nice btw). Please contact me at jonwage at
gmail.com if you would like a forum for your language added or if you
are interested in being a moderator.
