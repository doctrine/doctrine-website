Doctrine 2.1 is feature complete and we packaged up the first release
candidate to celebrate this day. So far we got exactly one backwards
compability complaint that was immediately fixed. You only have about 10
days to verify that this release candidate is working with your existing
2.0 code-bases. If you find some problems please report a bug on
[Jira](https://www.doctrine-project.org). We will provide everyone with
mugs/tshirts who is finding incompatible changes.

We plan to release only 1-2 bugfix releases of the 2.0.x branch, which
should give you lots of motivation to try out 2.1 with your projects.

We integrated a pretty substantial Annotation Reader refactoring just
today. Please test if this still works with your code-base using
annotations. See the [UPGRADE\_TO\_2\_1 file](https://github.com/doctrine/orm/blob/master/UPGRADE.md#upgrade-to-21)
for some information. You might need to adjust your bootstrapping code
to get it working.

The task now until the final release on june 30th will be to update the
documentation with all the changes that have landed in Doctrine 2.1. We
already created a 2.0.x branch of the docs that will freeze the current
state for those staying on 2.0. Additionally we will squash all the last
bugs that we find.

Grab the new code in the downloads section or on our [PEAR
channel](http://pear.doctrine-project.org)
