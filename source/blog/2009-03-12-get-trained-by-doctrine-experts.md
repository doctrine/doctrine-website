What is it?
===========

Whether you are an individual or with a team of developers, you can get
trained to use Doctrine by the professionals who built it and use it for
everyday client projects! The sessions are available for standalone
Doctrine or combined with the [symfony MVC
Framework](http://www.symfony-project.com). The training is a three day

symfony.
