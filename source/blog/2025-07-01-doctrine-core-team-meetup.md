We are organizing another Doctrine Core Team Meetup in Paris, France from
Tuesday, 7.10.2025 to Thursday, 09.10.2025. We are happy that
[JoliCode](https://jolicode.com/) will open their offices for us to meet. 

The goal is to get the current team together, discuss and work on Doctrine
DBAL, ORM and ODM.

We thank all of our [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/doctrine#sponsors) and
[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/doctrine) sponsors for making this
possible.
