Want to contribute?
-------------------

Open source software development is a battle against problems. There's no
better way to be part of the team than to grab a gun and dive into the
trenches. Want to get involved with the Doctrine community? This page aims to document
the different ways you can get involved with the community to help with
offering support or for getting support yourself.

GitHub
~~~~~~

Code contributions are coordinated via GitHub pull requests. Go `here <https://github.com/doctrine>`_,
find the project you want to contribute to and from there you will see a link for Pull Requests. You
can browse existing pull requests or create one of your own.

Mailing Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The primary means for communication between Doctrine users and developers is the mailing list hosted with Google Groups:

- `Doctrine User Mailing List <http://groups.google.com/group/doctrine-user>`_

IRC
~~~

If you prefer a more intimate and instant way of communicating with other
Doctrine users and developers you can use IRC. We host our channels on the
Freenode network:

- `irc.freenode.net/doctrine <irc://irc.freenode.net/doctrine>`_
- `irc.freenode.net/doctrine-dev <irc://irc.freenode.net/doctrine>`_
